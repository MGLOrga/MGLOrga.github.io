This is our first post, but not an official one. So who is going to write our real first blog or take the lead for our first project. Exciting!


[mglorga.github.io](mglorga.github.io) is the github page of our organization called **MGLOrga**. It is forked from [here](https://github.com/jpuritz/jpuritz.github.io). So if you guy want to add some content or make some changes to the site, go have a look at [here](https://github.com/jpuritz/jpuritz.github.io/blob/master/README.md). And thanks to [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/blob/master/README.md), which is a ready-to-use template for creating awesome website quickly. You can look at it and make your own website. After creating your own site, please let me know. I will attach the link to your name under the **resources** bar.

Below is some information you need to know to add content to the site.
- Edit the `_config.yml` file to change some settings to reflect our site. It is readble.
- To add pages to our site, you can either write a markdown file `.md` (good choice) or you can write an HTML file directly.
- Stick with markdown if you don't know HTML. I have no idea about HTML.
- Any file that you add inside the `_posts` directory will be treated as a blog entry. And this one will be the file we change on a daily basis.
- The notes we write will appear directly on the homepage. please refer to this for writing.
- I added **PROJECT** in the navigation bar. Hope we could do some interesting projects.
